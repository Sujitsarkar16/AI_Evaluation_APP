# OCR prompt for extracting text from images
OCR_PROMPT = """Extract ALL text EXACTLY as it appears in this image.
Keep the structure, layout, and alignment as close as possible.
For handwritten text, interpret it to the best of your ability.
For answer sheets, clearly distinguish between questions and answers.
For text that is unclear or ambiguous, indicate with [unclear] tags.
Ensure the final output is clear, coherent, and preserves the original intent.
Just return the plain text representation of this document without additional commentary.
Do not hallucinate or add text that isn't clearly visible in the image."""

# Prompt for mapping questions to answers
MAPPING_PROMPT = """Your task is to carefully analyze a document containing both questions and answers, and map each question to its corresponding answer. The document contains student responses to an exam.

Follow these steps:
1. Identify all questions in the document
2. For each question, find the corresponding answer text
3. Structure your response as a JSON array of objects, where each object has:
   - questionNumber: The question number (integer)
   - questionText: The full text of the question
   - answer: The student's answer to this question
   - maxMarks: If marks are specified for the question, include them (integer). If not specified, use 10 as default.

Handle any special cases:
- If multiple-choice questions are present, include the selected option(s) as the answer
- If a question has multiple parts (a, b, c, etc.), treat each as a separate question with appropriate numbering (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c)
- If a student has skipped a question, include it with an empty answer string
- If there is noise or irrelevant text between questions, ignore it

Format your response ONLY as a valid JSON array without any additional explanation or text. For example:
[
  {
    "questionNumber": 1,
    "questionText": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answer": "Paris is the capital of France",
    "maxMarks": 5
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": 2,
    "questionText": "Explain the concept of object-oriented programming.",
    "answer": "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code.",
    "maxMarks": 10

- Finding conceptual understanding beneath imprecise language
- Encouraging further development rather than penalizing gaps
