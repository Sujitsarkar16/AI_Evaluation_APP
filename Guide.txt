Now delete all the fallback functions and mock data. MY task is to use only specific tools to the project. Like use only Gemini for the OCR, the Agentic evaluation only each answer will be eavlated y the agents and will be graded. the mapping of question with answers will also be done using gemini api. I have provided the Prompt.py in sample codes folder utlilize that . and create similar.

When i will upload pdf in the Evaluation feature and click on agentic evaluation button it will work in this flow : perform OCR on the pdf by converting the pdf per page image . use the reactpdf library in the front end to do that then extract the text from those images. then the mapping of questions to the answers will takes place the each question will be mapped by identifing the correct answer to the question . then the final result of mapped question and answers will be fed to the evaluation agents
